# Windows Desktop Cleanup Tools.

# Wat?

* This is my store for a simple script i use to keep my windows workstation's desktop clear of debris.
* The script moves item on the desktop to a defined folder and allows comments to be made on the files moved.
* Each moved set of files is placed in a folder with a date.

# Why?

* The last four years have been *hectic* to say the least. Much like a physical desktop, i find in easier to keep on task by having a "clean" desktop on my windows machine(s).

# How?

* Uses windows batch file commands and is called from a shortcut on the taskbar.

# Wen?

* Initial script was written in the Fall of 2015 while i was studying at Ewha and it followed me home to Carroll.* 

# Wer?

* Used mostly on my Windows OS home machines.
